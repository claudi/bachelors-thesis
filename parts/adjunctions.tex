\section{Adjoint functors}
In category theory we can use functors to compare categories that are not
isomorphic or equivalent. An approach to this us to use functors in both
directions.

\subsection{Adjunctions}

This is one of the most important concepts in category theory, and
the definition can be found early on in any book on category theory,
such as~\cite{Awodey} or~\cite{Leinster}


\begin{definition}[Adjunction]
A pair of functors~\(F:\cat{C}\leftrightarrows\cat{D}:G\) is
an~\emph{adjunction} when for every object~\(C\) in~\(\cat{C}\) and every
object~\(D\) in~\(\cat{D}\) we have a bijection
\[
    \Hom_{\cat{D}}(FD, C) \cong \Hom_{\cat{C}}(D, GC)
\]
This must be natural both in~\(C\) and in~\(D\).
\end{definition}

This does not imply that they are inverses to each other, but that there are non
invertible comparison natural transformations
\[
    %\eta: \id_{\cat{C}} \Rightarrow \epsilon \circ \eta
    \eta:1\longrightarrow GF
\]
and
\[
    %\epsilon : \eta \circ\epsilon \Rightarrow \id_{\cat{D}}
    \epsilon:FG\longrightarrow 1
\]
where~\(\eta\) is called the~\emph{unit} and~\(\epsilon\) is
called the~\emph{counit} for the adjunction.

These satisfy the equations
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        F \arrow[r, "F\eta", rightarrow] \arrow[dr, equal] & FGF \arrow[d, "\epsilon F", rightarrow] \\
                                                           & F
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
        G \arrow[r, "\eta G", rightarrow] \arrow[dr, equal] & GFG \arrow[d, "G\epsilon", rightarrow] \\
                                                            & G
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
which are called the~\emph{triangle equalities} of adjunctions.

Adjunctions are a common occurrence throughout mathematics. In algebra, the
standard example is the adjunction between vector spaces and sets, where we have
a functor generating a vector space spanned on a set, and another extracting the
underlying set of a vector space. In our context the notion of adjunctions is
important because it generates monads.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:adjunction-induces-monad}
    Every adjunction induces a monad.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Given an adjunction~\(F:\cat{C}\leftrightarrows\cat{D}:G\) we can define an
    endofunctor by composing~\(F\) and~\(G\) to get~\(T = G \circ
    F:\cat{C}\longrightarrow\cat{C}\). It gets monad structure by
    setting~\(\mu_{A} = G \epsilon_{A}F\) for any object~\(A\) in~\(\cat{C}\)
    and using the unit of the adjunction as unit for the monad.

    It follows from the triangle equalities for unit and counit that~\(\mu\)
    and~\(\eta\) satisfy the monad laws.
\end{proof}
This is the most important example of monad. One can ask if every monad arises
like this, and the answer is yes.

There are two main constructions of an adjunction to produce a given monad: the
Kleisli construction and the Eilenberg--Moore construction (see~\cite{maclane}).
The Eilenberg--Moore construction seems to be more important in mathematics,
since it is about algebraic structures, but the Kleisli construction has turned
out to be central to theoretical computer science, and it is a main topic in
this work.

%(For example, the Kleisli category construction is not in the basic category
%theory books such as Awodey or Leinster, but it is in the more comprehensive
%text book of Mac Lane.)

\subsection{Kleisli category and adjunctions}
\begin{theorem}
    Given a category~\(\cat{C}\) and a monad~\((T,\eta,\mu)\) on~\(\cat{C}\)
    there exists an adjunction~\(F:\cat{C}\leftrightarrows\cat{C}_{T}:G\)
    such that it induces the monad~\((T,\eta,\mu)\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    From the Kleisli category~\(\cat{C}_{T}\), there is a natural
    functor~\(G:\cat{C}_{T}\longrightarrow\cat{C}\) which sends an
    object~\(A\in\cat{C}_{T}\) to~\(TA\in\cat{C}\) and sends a
    morphism~\(f:A\longrightarrow TB\) to the composite
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        TA \ar[r, "Tf"] & TTB \ar[r, "\mu_{B}"] & TB
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Indeed, given two morphisms~\(f:A\longrightarrow TB\)
    and~\(g:B\longrightarrow TC\) in~\(\cat{C}_{T}\) we have
    \begin{align*}
        Gg \circ Gf
            &= \mu_{C} \circ Tg \circ \mu_{B} \circ Tf \\
            &= \mu_{C} \circ \mu_{TC} \circ TTg \circ Tf \\
            &= \mu_{C} \circ Tg^{\ast} \circ Tf \\
            &= \mu_{C} \circ Tg \circ_{T} Tf \\
            &= \mu_{C} \circ T(g \circ_{T} f) \\
            &= G(g \circ_{T} f)
    \end{align*}
    and for any object~\(A\) in~\(\cat{C}\) we have
    \[
        G\eta_{A} = \mu_{A} \circ T\eta_{A} = \id_{TA}.
    \]

    Next we define the functor~\(F:\cat{C}\longrightarrow\cat{C}_{T}\)
    sending~\(A\) in~\(\cat{C}\) to~\(A\) in~\(\cat{C}_{T}\), and for sending a
    morphism~\(f:A\longrightarrow B\) in~\(\cat{C}\) to the composite
    in~\(\cat{C}_{T}\) given by
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        A \ar[r, "f"] & B \ar[r, "\eta_{B}"] & TB
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    We can check that~\(F\) is a functor. If we take~\(f:A\longrightarrow B\)
    and~\(g:B\longrightarrow C\) in~\(\cat{C}\) then
    \begin{align*}
        Fg \circ_{T} Ff
            &= {Fg}^{\ast} \circ Ff \\
            &= (\eta_{C} \circ g)^{\ast} \circ \eta_{B} \circ f \\
            &= \eta_{C} \circ g \circ f \\
            &= F(g \circ f)
    \end{align*}
    and for any object~\(A\) in~\(\cat{C}\) we have
    \[
        F\id_{A} = \eta_{A} \circ_{T} \id_{A} = {\eta_{A}}^{\ast} = \id_{TA}.
    \]

    Let's check that~\(F\) and~\(G\) are adjoint. We first observe
    that~\(GF=T\) by construction. Now we need to provide the unit and
    counit.

    If we define
    \[
        \eta_{A} : A \longrightarrow GF A
    \]
    to be the monad unit and
    \[
        \epsilon_{B} = {\id_{TB}}^{\ast} : FG B \longrightarrow B
    \]
    we get that the diagram
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        FGA \ar[r, "\epsilon_{A}"] \ar[d, "FG f"] & A \ar[d, "f"] \\
        FGTB \ar[r, "\epsilon_{B}"] & TB
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    is commutative, since
    \begin{align*}
        \epsilon_{B} \circ FGf
            &= \epsilon_{B} \circ \eta_{TB} \circ Gf \\
            &= Gf \\
            &= \mu_{B} \circ Tf \\
            &= f \circ \mu_{A} \\
            &= f \circ {\id_{TA}}^{\ast} \\
            &= f \circ \epsilon_{A}
    \end{align*}
    and as such,~\(\eta\) and~\(\epsilon\) are natural.

    Next we must check that they satisfy the triangle equalities of adjunctions.
    Using the kleisli triple laws we get
    \begin{align*}
        \epsilon_{FA} \circ F\eta_{A}
            &= {\id_{FA}}^{\ast} \circ F\eta_{A} \\
            &= {\id_{FA}}^{\ast} \circ \eta_{FA} \\
            &= \id_{FA}
    \end{align*}
    and
    \begin{align*}
        G\epsilon_{A} \circ \eta_{GA}
            &= G{\id_{A}}^{\ast} \circ \eta_{GA} \\
            &= G\id_{A} \\
            &= \id_{GA}
    \end{align*}

    Finally we check that the adjunction we have defined induces the original
    monad~\(T\). We already know that the endofunctor~\(T\) coincides for the
    monad and the adjunction, and it is also clear that the unit of the monad is
    the unit of the adjunction.

    Now we can check the multiplication. We see that
    \begin{align*}
        G \circ \epsilon_{B} \circ F \circ Tf
            &= G \circ \epsilon_{B} \circ \eta_{TB} \circ Tf \\
            &= G \circ TTf \\
            &= \mu_{B} \circ TTf,
    \end{align*}
    which matches~\ref{prop:adjunction-induces-monad}.
\end{proof}
